# MIPS-32 CPU

## Brief Introduction
- This is a project concentrated mainly on the implementation of MIPS-32 single-cycle, multi-cycle and pipeline CPUs. The branches are as follows:
  - **lab1-dev**: Single-cycle
  - **lab2-dev**: Multi-cycle
  - **lab3-dev**: Pipeline
## Background & Note
- This is the repository of the *Arch-2024 Spring* course in Computer Science, Fudan University.
- The CPU is implemented using *SystemVerilog*.
- It's just a fairly simple implementation of a small instruction set.
